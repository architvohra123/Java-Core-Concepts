inside jvm we have 2 types of memories:

Stack:
based on lifo (last in first out)
every method will have its own Stack
a stack will have 2 parts: key and value


Heap:
Heap is a global memory that is shared by all the objects in a program.
It is based on the principle of garbage collection, where the objects that are no longer referenced are removed from the memory.


// Important points to note about stack and heap:

// 1. Stack is LIFO (Last In First Out) whereas Heap is based on garbage collection.
// 2. Stack is used for storing primitive data types and object references, whereas Heap is used for storing objects in the form of key-value pairs.
// 3. Stack is used for execution of a program, whereas Heap is used for storing objects.
// 4. The size of the stack is smaller than the size of the heap.
// 5. The stack is thread-safe, whereas the heap is not thread-safe.
// The stack is thread-safe because each thread has its own stack, so the data stored in the stack is not shared between threads.
// The heap is not thread-safe because it is a global memory that is shared by all the threads, so the data stored in the heap can be accessed and modified by multiple threads simultaneously.
// 6. The stack is used for storing local variables and method parameters, whereas the heap is used for storing objects that are created using the new keyword.
