jdk is java development kit
we need this because when we write a code, we have to convert it into byte code (machine lang)
this will run on a machine, 

jvm is java virtual machine
compile your code using jdk and run the byte code on jvm
this is the place where code is actually executed.

JRE is Java runtime environment
maybe you have used some extra files or inbuilt libraries, where you will find this code?
this is where JRE comes.




JDK is (JRE + compiler or you can say javac)

JRE is (JVM + inbuilt libraries and files required for supporting code to run in new softwares)

JVM is (actual machine where compiled byte code runs/executed)
